Guidelines for contributing
===========================


##Requirements / Setup
--------------------
* A decent text editor (for text content) 
* Basic knowledge of [Markdown] for formatting your content
* A genuine excitement to open source your life and help others do the same


##Pull requests
--------------------
1. [Fork the book](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. Add awesome content or fix an [issue](https://github.com/nickfloyd/NerdLifeBalance/issues) 
3. Add your name (alphabetically) to the [Authors & Contributors page](https://github.com/nickfloyd/NerdLifeBalance/tree/master/manuscript/Contributors.txt) 
4. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/nickfloyd/NerdLifeBalance/pulls) 
5. When merged, a CI job will run and publish the content to [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/nerdlifebalance) and then later published to Create Space and Amazon.

You are welcome to send pull requests to me, in fact I encourage it - by doing so you'll be added to the [Authors & Contributors page](https://github.com/nickfloyd/NerdLifeBalance/tree/master/manuscript/Contributors.txt) in the book that you are granting me a non-exclusive, non-revokable, no-cost license to use the code, algorithms, patents, ideas and content in that work if I so choose. You also agree the content is provided as-is and you provide no warranties as to its fitness or correctness for any purpose.

Know that as the source owner I am obligated to make sure that the stories and content in the book are consistent and keep the integrity of the book intact. So if you submit a PR and it gets edited or not accepted please look at it just as though you were submitting a PR to any other open source project where the owners have to make sure the code fits the design and architecture.

##Royalties
--------------------
Most of us know that self publishing authors do not really get paid much at all (if anything) - that is the case and purpose with this book.  The intent is to not make money but rather to share and talk about things in our lives that are often avoided and assumed unchangeable. The book is currently [published on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/nerdlifebalance) for free (with option to buy), [published on Create Space](https://www.createspace.com/6059978) as a printed book and on Amazon as a [print](http://www.amazon.com/Nerd-Life-Balance-Open-Sourcing/dp/0997301716) and [ebook](https://www.amazon.com/Nerd-Life-Balance-Open-Sourcing-ebook/dp/B01BJN9ZXE) - neither of which can be set to a "free" price. 

**Know that your contributions will reach and help users but in terms of this book and royalties earned will not be redistributed.**
