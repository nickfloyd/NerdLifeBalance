-# The Behavior Parables

![](images/ch8.jpg)

It seems that we, as the human race, have several different opinions or ideas of what "success" means. Whether it's working one hundred hours a week to pull off the amazing project or, like me, taking every opportunity to teach my kids the how's and what's of the things I am passionate about, we all have a perspective. Maybe it's our perceived ideal. Regardless, there is a definition of what we think we should pursue and often times we are willing to fall on many swords to get there. 

[Game theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) defines our tendency to sprint toward certain behaviors like this:

>"The more 'successful' behaviors tend to be held more tenaciously and will occur more frequently."

Basically, if you do x and a positive result comes of it, you'll continue to do x. This is considered to be [reinforcement learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). It suggests that we will stop doing something else in favor of the thing that is making us "successful." There are a few potential stumbling blocks that many of us could face with this type of behavioral realignment. 

First, we sometimes allow outside influences to direct our idea of "success." Perhaps it was a college professor, your parents, a spouse, or your coworkers that began laying the bricks in your road to winning. Before you know it you're trying to fulfill someone else's dream or hopes.

It was the third night in a row he was at work, trying to keep up with the shear workload. Overwhelmed by commitments and to-dos. "How did I get here" he thought. The pressure was intense; so much so that the work became blurry and he was treading water by mashing random keys on the keyboard. 

He was going nowhere as a result of being told where to go. A week earlier, his boss came in and told him that the upcoming project was going to be critical in determining if he was going to "move up." He pondered his days in college and remembered that it seemed like a continual crunch and that his professors always said that he'd be successful. "If a constant push in overdrive worked then, surely it will work now..." 

This was not the first time this type of carrot had been dangled in front of him or his coworkers. Incrementally he moved through the organization and did well there. All that he had to pay was 100 hour weeks, several anxiety ridden nights, his health and of course his family. Years later, as he looked back over his shoulder, he did not feel very successful when he saw that he had lost everything except his job. 

***

This is a tight loop we all have the potential to get stuck in. Often, many of us can do our jobs really well and we can "succeed" in doing them with precision. *Winning feels good, losing feels bad.* In the confidence we have we can visualize what success means to us and apply that to our day jobs. The computer programmer might say that her job is not rocket science, the rocket scientist might say his job is not particle physics and the physicist might say their job isn't as complex as parenting. 

I've discovered that there is a correlation to things that are challenging to maintain but highly valuable, such as friendships or marriages. The problem is that because there are unknown factors in things like relationships they can become daunting but tremendously rewarding. These variables make it extraordinarily difficult to solve for x. On the other side things like working a lot has the potential to yield frequent, smaller rewards that are often assured - looking back to the idea of the Skinner effect.

What if what we thought was success was wrong? What if we are basing our definition of winning on a lifetime ago where the only thing we had to think about was how long of a car nap you could take before your next class?

I'd like to take a minute and look at some of the influencers and behaviors that create these ideal pictures of what we think winning looks like. Keep in mind that these things are not inherently bad per se (much like the money point in a previous chapter), but that what we do with them can create the not so favorable scenarios. 

*Once you're done going through some of these behavior parables ask yourself, what behaviors have been reinforced in the way you work and interact with the world around you. Do those behaviors still seem successful to you now?*

# The Death Of A Tauntan

In the Star Wars universe there are creatures known as Tauntans. These omnivores are indigenous to the planet Hoth. Hoth is a super cold planet that is almost uninhabitable save the creatures who called it home and the rebels that were trying to rebuild and regroup on it. 

The rebels used these creatures as patrol mounts to travel across the surface of Hoth because their vehicles couldn't cope with the cold.

As it would turn out as the story unfolds there are limitations to the Tauntans as well. Han Solo runs one into the ground looking for Luke, then proceeds to make a sleeping bag out of it to help our hero get "Luke-warm."

Have you ever caught yourself saying something like, "Once this project is over things will get back to 'normal'?" We do that because our vision is "siloed" in on a fixed point. We do some self-encouraging as we run hard we take a breath and we start running again. The "skinner effect" is invoked and we find ourselves getting kited along until we are drinking energy drinks and coffee every morning and finishing the day with a dose of melatonin just to stop our brains from spinning. 

Keep in mind I am not talking about crunch, there will always be that. There will always be times when we have a hack that we need to get out of our head and turn into code or an idea that needs a weekend and half a dozen trips to Home Depot to get done. I think we all have a tendency to be a bit hardheaded which can be a strength to help us persevere. No, I'm not talking about that at all; it is the patterns where we cannot walk away despite the project or activity. It's obsession.

Think of it like this: You decide that you really have a fondness for cats. You can debate quite effectively that they are the sole purpose the Internet was invented, you can quickly cite amazing facts about them and they are the topic of every one of your conversations. You have now effectively removed 2-dimensions from your character. Your friends seem to fade away and even your cats think you a bit odd. You are consumed. You get to the end of your life and you realize cleaning cat boxes and hairballs wasn't really all that and end up regretting the time lost.

That is what obsession can look like and it has the ability to rob you of many amazing years. If you find yourself sandwiching your days between energy drinks and melatonin tablets you might want to stop and check what "winning" really looks like to you because you might simply be stuck in a tight loop and eventually you're going to run out of memory and drop dead.

Never once in my career has being away from my family, friends or hobbies ever made anyone fonder of me or me of them. The absurdity of either spending more time physically or mentally at a place called "work" is really deceiving. From the outside, it looks like a developer is killing "it" during those late nights and weekends. I get some of my best software ideas just chatting with my kids about things completely unrelated to software or technology. Being around those I love helps me be more creative.

The type of thinking about the need to work long hours is dangerous because it is deceiving and can end up killing you. I tend to use Judge Dredd, the movie as an example when I bring this bad behavior up. In the movie, there was a family named the Angel Gang and one of the "gang" was named "Mean Machine" Angel who was a cyborg who had an adjustable dial on his head ranging from 1, where he is like an ill-tempered sea bass, up to 4, where he goes berserk. As the movie progresses, this family captures Judge Dredd and the "Mean Machine's" dial is turned all the way up. Eventually, the cyborg's head explodes because he was pushing an "extreme" level far too long - that's what could happen to us; we will burn out and it could be far worse than simply being tired.

Secondly, this behavior deceives your team and establishes the unrealistic expectation that your projects will always be done in an accelerated time frame, which will eventually become the expected norm.

Third, it deceives you. I know firsthand that burnout will occur and your ability to perform will diminish. We cannot always run as energy drink-infused developers if we want to continue to deliver great software.

Finally, overworked people often end up changing crafts. There is an economic law, the [law diminishing marginal utility](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp), which states that if you increase the consumption of something (keeping all other things constant) you will eventually lose interest in the thing you consume. Consider a food buffet: the first plate of food is awesome but each subsequent plate drives you deeper into misery and begins to look more like regret than food.

# The Costco Mentality

So you walk into your favorite bulk retailer / warehouse outlet and some of the first things you'll run into are the sample ninjas. These people are highly skilled at getting you to: 1. eat crap off a table you had no hand in preparing and 2. make you want to buy said crap so that you and your family can become addicted to a veritable cornucopia of deathly delights.

Unwittingly places like Costco allow my family in the doors. You see, my children are like locusts (I am sure any parents with pre-teens and up can relate); they leave in their paths little paper cups and worn out sample ninjas.

Sometimes the mentality of a nerd can be the little locust running through the store. We consume a little of the latest programming language, the most recent build of an OS, the next great cloud service and we leave in the wake little half-done projects or bits and pieces of provisioned websites. As the sampling continues we ping the moderators of the frameworks or projects we nibble on and talk about how great feature x and y would be and then turn around and abandon all interest in it because a new thing was put in front of us.

Sampling is not a bad thing at all. Trying out new things can help you learn, grow, develop skills and make you question the status quo. It's just that if all we do is sample we'll never actually get any thing done. Next time you stroll through the Costco of your field or interest remember to set some "try" constraints for yourself so that you can actually put a meal on the table.

# Infinite Planning

Planning is good. It helps us avoid things like project bloat, confusion and give us a general direction to head in. A few years back I began a project with my kids. It was a "zipline." The problems we were trying to solve were simple:

1. Have a faster way to get from the house to a trail head. At the time we had a really big yard and my kids legs are short.
2. Build something fun and safe for the family to enjoy

So, like most projects we do together we all sat down and began to plan. We were drawing up plans and calculating for tension and sag. About 5 minutes I lost my two-year old, an hour into it my four-year old dropped out because of boredom, another hour I lost the five-year old to "chores" (interesting how boredom can be a motivator), and finally roughly 30 minutes later my 7 and 9 year olds stopped the "planning" with one simple question: "Why are we doing this? It doesn't seem like we're actually getting anything done."

Then it hit me: When you gold plate everything you end up with absolutely nothing. We... I was gold plating the plan. Two years later we still had no zip-line until one day I see my now 2 years older kid spin by me in a flurry with one of his belts. Past incidents had taught me to investigate, so I followed him out the door. There it was in all of its glory, a makeshift zipline. They had found some old tension cable that I had from another project and pulled it between two trees. As he raced down the line, belt in hand, I realized that it's not failure when you plant seeds. Two years later he was inspired, using his own design, to build what I failed to plan. For all you parents, take opportunities to dream big with your kids because eventually they will make new, better dreams out of that which we thought was impossible. Just try to time box the conversation so that you don't gold plate your way into a two-year delay.

The drive for perfection is unfortunately a journey to insanity. Plain and simple, constantly tweaking something without delivering is a developer's pit of despair.

Ironically, we do this to ourselves because we love our perfect lines, application richness and the mental game of crafting fake criticism.

I've been down this road far too many times - I have even gold-plated specifications and documents! The part in every maker, developer, craft person that makes what we do so amazing is that we love to dream. We need to learn how to stop trying to "live the dream" and start iterating on it.

# The Steam Powered Punch

At the time of this writing there is a movement where boxed software and games have moved to an unboxed downloadable content (DLC) model. This approach has gained rapid approval because of the accessibility to users and their content, creator to user reach and it has opened the door to many creators who simply cannot work in the publisher / creator model. Basically you can buy, download content and play within minutes. It's ingenious, at least as a business model. For those of us who have collector mentalities it becomes a bit of a challenge because when things go on sale in this market place we tend to buy games we probably will never play. If you have a Steam account how many of the games in your library have you actually played? 50%? 30%? 10%?

The idea here is that there is a lot of things that desire our attention and there typically is a lot to be done. We need to learn to sift through the rocks to find the gold. Find the best "farming" spot in our lives. We sometimes need to give up the **good** to experience the **great**.

# Taking A Quantum Leap

I couldn't figure it out and the problem was filling my head like tribbles on a starship. After working for a month on a caching solution for a web application I was doing, I felt no closer to the ideal solution then when I started. 

Often times software developers will refer to the "two hardest problems in software." It's adage that refers to: 

1. Naming things in your projects
2. Caching invalidation strategy that will help performance and reduce the normal operating overhead of their applications. 

These things are referred to "the hardest things in computer science" for a good reason: 

1. Naming stuff is challenging, especially if others are involved
2. As a good curator of software you want to create a solution that will not end up being the [Rube Goldburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg) of cache invalidation solutions.

***
I was WFH (working from home) one day and I simply put my hands to my face and let out a pretty pitiful sigh. My seven year old at the time heard my anguish and asked what was wrong. 

>"Nothing kiddo, I'm just trying to figure something out." 

>"Tell me, I can help."

We've built a culture of fearlessly sharing in my house. I call it the "know nothing" principle. Much like Occam's razor, it's an attempt to draw out the obvious by asking the impossible. We ask questions in our house to simultaneously learn for ourselves and to make others think. I am sure most everyone practices this on some level.

Knowing that I have not taught him the principles of caching in coding yet, I distilled the problem to a few basic concepts and explained those to him. His response was astonishing. He said, "How do you know you need to do that [use caching]?" I was speechless. He single-handedly unwound all of my preconceived notions about the project and the gold plating I was apparently doing.

It turns out that my assumptions about the need for caching the data I was caching were completely wrong for this project and it was not needed. If I had compartmentalized my work and life I would've ended up missing out on a lesson my son was giving me on critical thinking. I would also miss out on the moment where my son solved one of the most challenging questions in computer science.

***

I have found that attempting to turn off life at work and work at life is often frustrating. Most developers are probably continually mentally working to resolve questions about how their environment works or how to transform a slow process into a faster one.

Being at work does not throw a life switch nor does being home involve throwing a work switch. Think of this as more of a circuit without a switch: your passion is the power source and work and life are the wires that are attached to what you want to accomplish or do. Instead of having your work ideas compartmentalized why not try talking about them with your friends and family - you might be surprised what happens. Talk to someone at work about things going on in your life. I always wondered when having a personality that you wanted to share at work became taboo; share it, you might find that you might have more in common than just code.

This idea is often misunderstood as: "you're saying think about work all the time" or "I should bring work home and push other stuff to the side?" Not at all! I'm simply pointing out that your inner nerd components, whether it's code, bikes, writing, weight lifting or whatever, are part of you; they should be expressed and shared. It will inherently be part of what you love to do and talk about.

Just like a coin has two functional sides to be valid currency, we also have these sides as "nerds" that we need to validate as our life currency - find out what your currencies are, share them and watch the excitement spread like wildfire.

The point is that we can easily miss the whole picture by trying to be a quantum person. Try treating work and life more like Velcro and less like sand paper. You might find that you have a lot to learn from your family and friends.

# Impostor

You're starting a new job today. With the new adventure comes loads of excitement, stress, an opportunity to learn something new and perhaps an opportunity to get schooled. Then it happens; the excitement turns to dread. The people you are working with seem to have a Matrix like ability to "jack in" and do anything while you're still working in bullet time. They are making a difference while you fill out docs for Human resources. 

Let's turn off our emotional roller coasters for a minute and reflect. You made it through the interview, the team hopefully likes you and they wouldn't have hired you unless you had something to offer.

The quickest way to being perceived as an impostor is to act like one. Acting "sketchy" is one way to earn your impostor badge. Communicating with partial information, flip-flopping and even exhibiting an always agreeable mode will come across as nonsense.

Another way is to act with hubris. Being prideful or boastful is one of the quickest ways to discredit yourself and your abilities. Let your "yes" be "yes" and your "no" be "no." There is absolute beauty in respecting simplicity. Can you imagine how much we could get done if we all simply practiced saying, "I don't know."

Here's the crux: When you are comparing yourself and your skills to other people you are doing yourself and your team a disservice. You're putting your eyes on you instead of on what needs to be done. Have you ever told yourself "I'll never be good enough?" Let me let you in on a little secret: you're right. You see, if you constantly put your sights on what everyone else can do how will you ever know what you can do? You are jumping for a block you cannot hit, Mario. Try breaking your own blocks. 

I often ask myself who defines "good enough" and when I ask that question I often find that it is me who sets the bar and sometimes it's based on what others can do.

As a side note, if you are an impostor, one of the best and most risky thing you can do is talk to your boss or friend and let them know you want to seek opportunities to learn and grow where you are. You also might be in the wrong place and you simply need to get in the right place to thrive. We have too few hours on this earth to spend them doing something we really have no interest in doing.

# The Pain Of Sand

You're on a beach, the sun is out and the waves are crashing. It's a beautiful day. You build sand castles with the kids and when you're done you decide to go for a quick run. Halfway through your run you realize you have several grains of sand in your britches and all of the running and rubbing has caused you a seriously painful rash.

One or two grains of sand in your life can quickly become a painfully searing rash. Most likely we spend more time in the environment of our craft than we do sleeping. If your work bench is in disarray, your developer IDE settings work against you, your office layout makes you stumble or if your home school setup causes your eye to twitch rather than spend time teaching you might have a problem.

Like most learned things we will naturally begin to avoid the painful things in our environment. In terms of the small irritating things in our environments these can be grains of sand that can add up quickly and begin to irritate on a massive scale. I call this the **grain of sand factor.** It is the idea that over time if we do not address the small irritants in our lives quickly that overtime the net result is that they will be really expensive to deal with and could drive us away from what we love to do.

The following are two representations of this grain of sand thinking. Even though this line of thinking is spelled out using a contrived algorithm the principle is somewhat simple: know when to stop and address something that is irritating you and distracting you from getting real work done.

**The Bad Grain**

![](images/bad_grain.png)

**The Good Grain**

![](images/good_grain.png)

Shake the sand out as frequently as possible. I've been blessed to have the opportunity to mentor many developers and I generally tell them, 

>"A good developer knows how to shake the sand out, a great developer knows when to shake it out."

Accept that there will be times when you'll have to take the sand but know when it's time to shake out and clean house.

# Talking About Things

There is an old proverb that states: "Silence is golden." The origin of this is still uncertain however there are instances of this thought appearing in ancient Egypt, in the Judaic Biblical commentaries (the Midrash), the English poet Thomas Carlyle referenced it, James Russell Lowell quotes it in 'The Bigelow Papers', in Brian Aldiss' 'The Primal Urge' and even William Shakespeare tips his hat to the thought in "Romeo and Juliet."

If you are a parent, most likely you have used a form or version of this with your kids. What a paradox our children are! I find it amazing and sometimes painful that they are continually sharing their stream of consciousness it an audible form as if they are compelled by something. I think we can learn something from how our kids do this. 

My theory is the reason that they are talking nonstop is that they are simply processing the universe. Something that I feel that we as adults have sadly "grayed out." If we stop, unplug from our "i-tether" and look around at the whole of creation I am sure eventually we will begin describing its amazing design to our friends and family. We will be as children, trying to take in the creativity of it all.

As people who write software, cross stitch, build computers, generate art we owe it to ourselves to plug-out and plug-in to life around us. Talk out loud to others and ourselves. 

This is one of the reasons I feel we should take our passions "home" with us. By talking what you love to your friends and family you open up opportunities to share some thing you love while building relationships that are lasting. If we genuinely love what we do we will have this burning desire to share it. Think about the times when you are working on something tough or thinking through an idea you have. Do you talk to yourself? Perhaps you talk to your pets or inanimate objects. While some might consider talking to one's self the beginnings of schizophrenia many feel that it's a way for logically processing the complexities of what we do.

# The Board Of Directors

***
I had been haunted by a dream where I solved a super hard problem that I had faced for about a month. The problem was seriously challenging and it was constantly hanging over my head drilling holes in my subconscious so it was not unusual that I would have a dream about it. In fact I had many dreams but this was the first time I'd "solved" it in the dream; usually the dream was knowing that the problem existed but I had to solve an equally as hard problem like naming something or caching before I could get to it. 

Like most dreams the solution eluded me and I decided to place my tablet next to my bed so that when I did get the dream again I could capture it. This problem was chewing me up. 

I had the dream again and with delight I opened my eyes and attempted to cast a "root" on it. I turned on my tablet, almost missed my pass code 3 times (if I'd missed it the 3rd time I would've resorted to paper - I was that desperate), opened up my email and began drafting what was going to be the most epic solution - it possibly would even cure all diseases and world hunger. I finished and I mashed send and passed back out, elated that it was finished. 

The next day I woke expectantly to an inbox of joy, there it was the message I sent myself. Incidentally if you have a propensity to solve hard problems using dreams and care to jot them down, may I suggest you not use email? Miraculously I received my email, but as you might have guessed it was not exactly what I had intended to send. But let me not tip my hand just yet, as River Song would say "careful, no spoilers."

I had inadvertently added folks to the "To" and combined with auto correct hijinks and an obvious sleep deprived conscious I had the makings for an email sent from [Benny Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Hill) of the Matrix. Interwoven with code there were double entendres and unfortunate adjectives sprinkled about. It was a veritable cornucopia of embarrassment. Oh and absolute shocker, it did not solve the problem. 

When I got to work, where I spent most of the day avoiding HR, a few of the folks had passed the email around and were getting some enjoyment from it. While I was eating my humble pie someone asked me, "So what's the problem you've been working on?" With an expectant sigh I showed him the thing that had captivated my attention and dreams. To which he replied, "oh yeah I've seen this before." My first thought was "impossible," who would keep the solution to world hunger and my software problem to themselves!

As he took me through the solution I realized a few things:

1. The answer was literally feet away
2. I should never send sleep induced emails
3. No one asked me to try to solve this on my own. Ever.

# Going Mental

Mental illness in the work place and at home is a really serious problem that this modern workforces faces today. Sadly very little is discussed about it and often those being challenged by problems have limited outlets for fear of being cast out with a label.

The fact is that most of us have crossed paths with this at one time or another. Stress is a form of mental illness, though temporary, it can cause both psychological and physiological damage. We have a tendency to try to act strong when we are terrified on the inside. It could be that we don't want to appear weak or perhaps we don't want to face a label but whatever the case is, ignoring it can and will cause problems. 

A few years back I was building an epic sandbox for my kids in our backyard in Texas. Texas has a very unique soil, some call it clay I call it brimstone. Part of the project required that I get a 2 1/4 PVC pipe and hammer it into the ground. I didn't have a sledge-hammer but I did have a 40lb dumbbell that I could swing like one. 

You might have guessed that it did not go well. My last swing slightly missed the pipe and with indiscriminate justice I severed an inch off of my right index finger and severely damaged my right middle finger as well. In the following weeks I soon realized that I was going to have to relearn how to type, how to grip as well as many other things I had simply taken for granted. This took a toll on me because I thought that I had lost the ability to do what I felt I was designed to do. My tools felt broken and I felt lost. Fortunately I had (and still have) an amazing wife and group of scrappy kids to support me and take me through re-imagining what I already knew - that it was going to be OK and I will just write software a little different now.

There are many out there that do not have a support system. If you see your coworker or friend struggling, instead of ignoring the anguish on their face reach out to them and ask them how they are doing. I'm not talking about the hollow "Hey how's it going?" Let me give you a booster for conversation since many of us might be introverts:

>You: "Hey how's it going?"
>
>Friend: "Ok, I guess."
>
>You: "No, really how are you doing?"

I know this is a hard thing for us to do, we are heads down in whatever we are doing, we have our own problems, we are struggling in our own ways but we owe it to humanity to be better than what is expected of us. 

>We don't have to be heroes we simply need to be human. 

Reaching out to others in need not only has the power to help someone in need but it has the power to change the world.
